# Submission Guidelines — Course Discord

Use this file as a copy/paste template when posting assignment or project submissions in the "intro to git and github" Discord channel.

Invite link: https://discord.gg/CP6vJQbA8S

When you post a submission, include the following information in a single message (copy/paste the template then fill it):

---
**Assignment / Project:** Day X — <brief title>
**Name:** Your Full Name
**GitHub repo:** https://github.com/<your-username>/repo-name
**PR link (if applicable):** https://github.com/<your-username>/repo-name/pull/NNN
**Files changed / Branch names:**
- main
- feature-branch
**Short notes (1–2 lines):** What you did / any special notes
**Screenshot (optional):** attach image(s) if requested by the rubric
---

Submission checklist (copy/paste and mark done):
- [ ] Repo is public and accessible
- [ ] PR link included (if assignment requires it)
- [ ] Branch name(s) provided
- [ ] Files updated (list shown above)
- [ ] I followed the rubric in the lesson

Notes for instructors / graders:
- One message per student (or one message per team for team projects). For team projects, tag the teammates and explicitly list which file/page each student contributed.
- Use the rubric at the end of the lesson for grading.

If you need help joining the Discord server, contact the instructor directly via GitHub or open an issue in this repo.
