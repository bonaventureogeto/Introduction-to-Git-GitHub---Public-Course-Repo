## How to work through the lessons

- Read the lesson for the day in `course/week*/day*.md`.
- Perform the exercises locally using the terminal and Git (examples use HTTPS clone URLs).
- Use branches for features and open Pull Requests to demonstrate the workflow.

Files you may use for exercises:
- `students.md` (added to repo) — used in Week 2 Day 8 as a simple file for students to update.

## Submission (important)

All course submissions should be posted to the course Discord server, in the channel named "intro to git and github".

- Invite link (use this to join): https://discord.gg/CP6vJQbA8S
- For consistent grading, follow the submission template in `SUBMIT_GUIDELINES.md` — copy/paste the template into the Discord channel when submitting.

Why Discord?
- Centralized, real‑time discussion and feedback.
- Easier for instructors to track submissions, answer questions, and manage peer review.

## Grading & Rubrics

Each daily assignment includes a short rubric at the end of the lesson (typically 100 pts). Rubrics list deliverables (repo link, PR link, branch names) and point allocation. Projects have their own rubrics in the project files.

Instructors will grade submissions posted on Discord using the rubric in the lesson. For team projects, one team member should post the final submission and tag the teammates.

## Instructor / Class Repo

The course uses this public instructor repo for some exercises:

https://github.com/bonaventureogeto/Introduction-to-Git-GitHub---Public-Course-Repo

Students will fork this repo for Week 2 exercises involving forking and PRs.
